# 🔭 Light-as-Intelligence: Multi-Stage RAG System

A **portfolio-grade, deployable RAG system** that treats information like light:
observed, refracted, reflected, interpreted, and evaluated.

## Architecture
RAG is modeled as a **multi-stage observation pipeline** inspired by physical light behavior.

Stages:
1. Ingestion (Observation)
2. Chunking (Diffraction)
3. Embedding (Refraction)
4. Retrieval (Reflection)
5. Reasoning (Interpretation)
6. Evaluation (Noise & Hallucination)

## Run Locally

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
docker-compose up --build
```
